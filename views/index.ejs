            This is just a simple site so people can look through the pictures and download them if they see anything they like.

            I just tried to get all the plays throughout the game.  Some pictures don't seem to be that interesting but I will leave that up to the parents.
            You should be able to right click on an image and save or download it.
            The pictures have been optimized for the web so they may not print very well.  If you want a larger copy to print then feel free to email me the date and image name and I will try to get you the original shot.

            I am limited on space and bandwidth so I am not sure how long the games will stay up.
